# Project Research Report

This project delved into a research paper by David B. Hollian and Charles Prysby to see what swayed voters in the 2016 election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. We attempted to recreate and compare results. In this repository, I've included the data used, the data codebook, the code for statistical analysis, and the final report.
